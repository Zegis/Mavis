Application that generates  data to paste in posts for my [blog](http://kofun.pl).
Right now it:
* Generate html for unordered list of bolded book titles for "One houndred years in library" - commenting readed books series for my [personal blog](http://blog.kofun.pl). 
* Generates basic bar chart containing books and games I've finished for the first time in my life during current month, wroted posts and finished tasks.
* Generates line chart containing books, games finished for the first time, and wroted posts during year.

### Dependences:
To generate various charts I use [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/).
